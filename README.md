1. The website is using `npm` as package manager, so we need to download all the  packages that the websites is dependent on. You do this by running the following command in the project folder:

    `npm install`

2. After all the packages are installed we use

    `npm start`

    This will start a local development server on the location `http://localhost:3000`.
    Open this site in the browser and you can see the website and make changes.

3. When making changes to the website you should to this in another branch than `master` and make a pull request to merge your feature branch with the `master` branch. To make a new branch use the command:

    `git checkout -b <Branch Name>`

    The branch name should reflect the update you are doing to the website.
